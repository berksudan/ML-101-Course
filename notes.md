## Outlier Analysis
- For multi-dimensional example: 
```bash
+-------+------------+-----+------------+
| Gender| isPregnant | Age | isSmoking? |
+-------+------------+-----+------------+
| Male  |  	Yes		 |  25 |   Yes		| ---> Outlier & Wrong data!
+-------+------------+-----+------------+
| Female|   Yes		 |  25 |   Yes		|
+-------+------------+-----+------------+
| Male  |   No 	     |  25 |   No		|
+-------+------------+-----+------------+

### A. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
- Data, Types of Data
- Population/Sample Data
- Graphical Representation of variables in form of Graph & Tables: Bar/ Pie Chart
- Frequency Distribution Table:  
	- Relative frequency = frequency / total frequency
- Measures of central tendency: Mean, mode, median
- Measure of Asymmetry: Skewness -> Right (Positive) Skewness, Left (Negative) Skewness
- Dispersion of a set of data points around its means value: Sample/Population VAR Formula, Sample/Population STD Formula
- Coefficient of Variation
- Covariance & Correlation

### B. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS
- Probability distribution: Normal Distribution, Standard Normal Distribution, Central Limit Theorem
- Estimators and Estimates: Estimators, Estimates, Confidence Interval, Margin of Error
- Studentâ€™s T Distribution

### HYPOTHESIS TESTING
- Scientific Method
- Null Hypothesis (H_0), Alternative Hypothesis (H_1 or H_A)
- Decisions: Level of Significance, Confidence Level, Rejection region, Non rejection region
- Statistical Errors: Type-I Error (False Positive), Type-I Error (False Negative)
- P-value: A small/large p-value
